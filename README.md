# Blockchain Full-Stack Developer

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I am a blockchain full-stack developer proficient in **TypeScript**, **Solidity**, **React**, **React Native**, **Subgraph**, and **Node.js**. With expertise spanning both frontend and backend development, I take a holistic approach to creating scalable and efficient blockchain solutions.

### ðŸ”¹ Blockchain Projects

- **[Enzyme dApp](https://app.enzyme.finance)**: Contributed significantly to the development of this digital asset management platform, which currently holds a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $250M. Improved functionality, stability, and automation through extensive protocol integrations, including **Aave**, **Arrakis**, **Aura**, **Balancer**, **Compound**, **Convex**, **Curve**, **GMX**, **Kiln**, **Liquity**, **Maple**, **TheGraph**, **Uniswap**, **Yearn**, and more. My contributions spanned the entire stack, including **frontend**, **backend**, **subgraphs**, **SDK**, and **smart contracts**, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
  - Repositories:
    - **[Enzyme Protocol](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol)**
    - **[Enzyme Subgraphs](https://github.com/enzymefinance/subgraphs)**
    - **[Enzyme SDK](https://github.com/enzymefinance/sdk)**

- **[Uniswap Staking App](https://github.com/avantgardefinance/UniStaking)**: Developed an engaging staking application funded by a grant from the Uniswap Foundation, enhancing user engagement and investment opportunities through the staking of UNI tokens.

- **[GMX Integration](https://gov.gmx.io/t/open-grant-application-gmx-enzyme/3582)**: Led the end-to-end integration process across smart contracts, backend, and frontend, supported by a GMX grant.

- **[Message Bridge](https://github.com/KedziaPawel/message-bridge)**: This Proof of Concept (PoC) project facilitates message transfer between two distinct networks. The sender contract is deployed on the Sepolia network, while the receiver contract operates on the Optimism Sepolia network. The sender contract transmits messages that the receiver contract processes, enabling efficient cross-network communication.

- **[Gold Wallet](https://github.com/bitcoinvault/GoldWallet)**: Spearheaded the development of Gold Wallet, a secure cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin Vault, a Bitcoin fork designed to enhance security features. Available on **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/goldwallet-for-btcv/id1515116464?l=pl)** and **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.goldwallet.wallet&hl=pl&gl=US)**.

- **Electric Wallet Pro**: Led the development of Electric Wallet Pro, a secure and user-friendly mobile wallet designed for managing digital assets on the Elcash blockchain. As a Bitcoin fork, ELCASH facilitates fast, efficient transfers and offers fee-free transactions for stakers. Available on **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/electric-wallet-pro/id1559523681)**.

### ðŸ”¹ Blog
- **[Step-by-Step Debugging for Deployed Solidity Smart Contracts](https://paulked.com/step-by-step-debugging-for-deployed-solidity-smart-contracts)**: A comprehensive guide that explores effective techniques for debugging deployed smart contracts.
