# Blockchain Full-Stack Developer

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I am a blockchain full-stack developer proficient in **TypeScript**, **Solidity**, **React**, **React Native**, **Subgraph** and **Node.js**, with expertise spanning both frontend and backend. I bring a holistic approach to building scalable, efficient blockchain solutions.

### ðŸ”¹ Blockchain Projects
- **[Enzyme dApp](https://app.enzyme.finance)**: Played a key role in developing this digital asset management platform, now boasting a $250M Total Value Locked (TVL). Enhanced functionality, stability, and automation through extensive protocol integrations, including **Aave**, **Arrakis**, **Aura**, **Balancer**, **Compound**, **Convex**, **Curve**, **GMX**, **Kiln**, **Liquity**, **Maple**, **TheGraph**, **Uniswap**, **Yearn**, and more. Contributed across the entire stack, working on the **frontend**, **backend**, **subgraphs**, **SDK**, and **smart contracts** to ensure a seamless, efficient user experience. 
  - Repositories:
    - **[Enzyme Protocol](https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol)**
    - **[Enzyme Subgraphs](https://github.com/enzymefinance/subgraphs)**
    - **[Enzyme SDK](https://github.com/enzymefinance/sdk)**
- **[Uniswap Staking App](https://github.com/avantgardefinance/UniStaking)**: Developed an engaging staking app funded by a Uniswap Foundation grant.

- **[Message Bridge](https://github.com/KedziaPawel/message-bridge)**: This Proof of Concept (PoC) project enables message transfer between two different networks. The sender contract is deployed on the Sepolia network, and the receiver contract is on the Optimism Sepolia network. The sender contract sends a message, which the receiver contract then receives, facilitating cross-network communication.
- **[Gold Wallet](https://github.com/bitcoinvault/GoldWallet)**: Led the development of Gold Wallet, a secure cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin Vault, a Bitcoin fork, designed to offer enhanced security features. Available on **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/goldwallet-for-btcv/id1515116464?l=pl)** and **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.goldwallet.wallet&hl=pl&gl=US)**.
